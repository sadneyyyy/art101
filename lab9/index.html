      <h2>Challenges 	</h2>
      <p>I had many challenges with this lab and understanding what I am doing. I dont really understand
      what is happening in javascript or how to do the basics so now we are advancing past my knowledge even more.</p>
      <h2>Problems 	 </h2>
      <p>I think my main problem is that I dont fully understand whats going on when we use many of the Functions
      in both html or js so when I excute them I am just following along with what im doing in lecture without truly
      knowing what any of it means at all.</p>
      <h2>Results  </h2>
      <p>My results for this lab were better than the last I am getting more comfortable.</p>
