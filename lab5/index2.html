    	<h2>Lab 5 Index</h2>
      <h4>Challenges 	&#128528; </h4>
      <p>We didnt have any real challeges other than finding a partner. For this lab I asked
			tons of people all week and everyone already had lab partners.</p>
      <h4>Problems 	&#128517; </h4>
      <p>We didnt have many problems other than the console generating errors which we had to work through</p>
      <h4>Results &#128513;</h4>
      <p>Overall, this lab gave us a better understanding of java script. Sidney is still a little
				new to java script but petr was able to walk her through the steps. Sidney is still a little
				confused but we're glad this Lab allowed us to understand java script a little more</p>
