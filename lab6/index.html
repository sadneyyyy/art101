    <h1>Lab 6 Index</h1>
      <h2>Challenges 	&#128528; </h2>
        <p>We didnt have any real challeges for this one. May and Sidey had some trouble on task 1 and peter
					was able to help walk us through it but it wasnt anything too major.</p>
      <h2>Problems 	&#128517; </h2>
        <p>We didnt have many problems other than the console generating errors which we had to work through. Sidney was still not able to properly link
			here photo </p>
      <h2>Results &#128513;</h2>
        <p>Overall, this lab gave us a better understanding of console uses and how we can work with them. Sidney is still a little
					new to java script but petr and may where able to help her understand better what was going on. Sidney is still a little
					confused but she is glad her partners where so helpful and willing to work with her.</p>
