<h1>Hello world</h1>
<p>
	<p> Sidney and May met through Slack. They are both in their fourth year
	            planning to graduate in the spring. May is a double major with Art and
	            Film and Digital Media, and Sidney is a double major with Critical Race
	            and Ethnic Studies and Art. They are both currently finishing up
	            their last year in Santa Cruz. They initially signed up for Art 101 due
	            to their interest in digital art.May's prefered medium is digital animation
	            and Sidney's is photography. Due to their appreciation for digital art,
	            it made it pretty easy for them
	            to partner up. They are both taking this class
	            to help them develop a digital portfolio that they can carry with
	            them into the professional art world. May's goal after graduation is to move
	            to a larger city, and be hired at a major animation studio.
	            Sidney's goal is move to New York after graduation and work freelance until she can
	            hopefully create her own brand of clothing in order to have full creative control over
	            her career.
