    <h2>Lab 4 Index</h2>

      <h4>Challenges 	&#128528; </h4>
        <p>Some ecounters we found was through naviagating Sublime. Neither of us
        were really aquantinted with the text editor, so it was a little intimidating
      to take on a new text editor, especially when we thought we just got the hang
    of Atom</p>
      <h4>Problems 	&#128517; </h4>
      <p>We tried to understand what exactly is defined as a computer task for Task 2.
        As art majors, we assumed making a Gif through a computer application like
        Adobe Photoshop would qualify, but we knew that couldn't be coded. To be on
        the safe side we chose to choose a computer task that we knew could be coded.</p>
      <h4>Results &#128513;</h4>
        <p>Overall, this lab gave us a better understanding of psuedocode. We are still
        a little more on the hesitant side, but we're glad this Lab allowed us to engage
      with pseudocode directly. We think that it's important to provide context to
    outside coders through psudocode as well as your own personal notes. </p>
